                    <q> God made mud. God got lonesome. So God said to some of the mud, "Sit up!" "See all I've made," said God, "the hills, the sea, the sky, the stars." 
                    <br>And I was some of the mud that got to sit up and look around. Lucky me, lucky mud.
                    <br>I, mud, sat up and saw what a nice job God had done. Nice going, God.  <br>Nobody but you could have done it, God! I certainly couldn't have.
                    <br> I feel very unimportant compared to You. The only way I can feel the least bit important is to think of all the mud that didn't even get to sit up and look around.  <br>I got so much, and most mud got so little. Thank you for the honor!
                    <br> Now mud lies down again and goes to sleep. What memories for mud to have! What interesting other kinds of sitting-up mud I met! I loved everything I saw! Good night.  <br> I will go to heaven now. I can hardly wait. <br> To find out for certain what my wampeter was... <br> And who was in my karass...  <br>And all the good things our karass did for you. <br>
                    Amen.

                Music has been a lifelong passion of mine, and I enjoy playing both classical guitar and clarinet. I am particularly drawn to classical, jazz, and Turkish music, as each offers unique expressions of emotion and technical depth.

            Reading has always been one of my greatest passions, and I enjoy exploring books across all genres, though I have a special love for classics. I find immense joy in immersing myself in rich narratives, thought-provoking ideas, and timeless literary works. 
             <br>
             <br> One of my favorite authors is Haruki Murakami, whose storytelling blends surrealism with deep emotional themes. Books provide me with endless inspiration, new perspectives, and a deeper understanding of different cultures, histories, and philosophies.
