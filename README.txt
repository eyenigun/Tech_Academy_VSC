Using the template in http://htmlandcssportfolio.com/, site I have created my Web site. That has different html files each corresponds to my hobies. Some of them are developped now. Some I aill develop later by using different technologies.
This page uses both css as an external styling file and Bootstrap 4.
I have customized some fonts, colors effects etc.

I used visual studio code.

For the picture I used Windowsa applications

All are published in my GitHub repository. I write all the code by myself, getting help from the course material and related support web pageg/online resources
